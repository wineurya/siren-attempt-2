        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p><strong id=bigger>Siren stands out as a dating app that 
            prioritizes user safety in the online dating scene. 
            It's designed to preemptively identify potential risks, 
            ensuring users can make informed decisions about their interactions. 
            Through our innovative features like 'Red Flags' and mandatory video 
            calls, Siren has demonstrated that safety can be seamlessly 
            integrated into the dating experience. The result is an app 
            where users can date more confidently and securely</strong>

        <h2>Product Problem Space</h2>
        <p><strong id=bigger>The challenge with online 
            dating has always been the balance between easy 
            connections and safety. Traditional dating apps focus on 
            quick matches, often overlooking user safety. Siren addresses 
            this gap, particularly for young, casual daters. We hypothesized 
            that incorporating clear safety signals on profiles and introducing 
            mandatory video calls after a certain number of texts would enhance 
            user trust and safety. These hypotheses were prioritized based 
            on their potential impact on user safety and the feasibility 
            of implementation.</strong></p>

        <p><strong id='bigger'>Sprint 1 (Red Flags Feature):</br>Week 1 of the Sprint </br></strong>
            Our first sprint was dedicated to the 'Red Flags' feature. 
            We created scenarios using fake profiles with varying 
            levels of warnings – from multiple red flags to none. 
            The goal was to observe if and how these warnings 
            influenced user interactions. The results were enlightening. 
            Users generally avoided profiles with red flags and showed 
            cautious interest in those with yellow flags. This 
            feedback validated our assumption that clear warning 
            signals could significantly impact user decision-making.</p>

        <p><strong id='bigger'>Sprint 1 (Going Forward):</br></strong>
            In response to user feedback, we refined the 'Red Flags' feature. 
            We introduced a pull-out menu for report details, ensuring the 
            information was accessible yet not overly prominent. This approach 
            balanced the need for safety information with a non-intrusive user 
            experience, addressing concerns that too much emphasis on reports might 
            negatively affect user interactions.</p>

        <p><strong id='bigger'>Sprint 2 (Mandatory Video Calls):</br></strong>
            The second sprint focused on the mandatory video call feature. 
            The premise was simple but powerful: require a video call 
            after a set number of text messages. This was tested by 
            simulating video calls between users and team members, 
            with the latter portraying profiles with yellow or red flags. 
            The aim was to see if users could identify deceptive behavior 
            during these calls.</p>

        <p><strong id='bigger'>Sprint 2 (Scheduling):</br></strong>
            The insights gained were significant. Users were able 
            to detect inconsistencies or deceptive behavior, 
            leading to more informed decisions about whether 
            to continue interactions. However, we also recognized 
            the need for a more user-friendly approach to 
            scheduling these calls. As a result, we implemented 
            a warning system that alerted users about the approaching 
            video call requirement, allowing them to plan these calls 
            more conveniently. This adjustment not only enhanced the 
            functionality of the feature but also respected user 
            preferences for a more informal scheduling process.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>The journey of developing Siren was a profound learning experience 
            in user-centered design and innovation. 
            If I were to revisit this project, 
            I would like to go deeper into user testing and 
            explore an even wider range of safety features. 
            This experience highlighted the importance of continuous 
            learning, adaptation, and empathy towards user needs, 
            ultimately contributing to my growth as a professional 
            in the tech industry.</p>
